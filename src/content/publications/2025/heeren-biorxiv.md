The evolutionary relationships between hosts and their symbionts offer valuable insights into the origins, maintenance, and consequences of biological interactions. While co-divergence and host-switching have been extensively explored in systems such as *Wolbachia*–arthropod symbioses or viruses infecting vertebrates, similar investigations in protistan parasites remain scarce. The *Leishmania*–*Leishmaniavirus* (LRV) association offers a rare opportunity to study co-divergence in a medically relevant symbiotic system, in which the virus modulates the parasitic disease severity in humans.

Here, we used total RNA sequencing to capture both the *Leishmania* transcriptome and the LRV genome simultaneously, enabling the first comprehensive investigation of the co-evolutionary history of *Leishmania* and LRV across different hierarchical levels (subgenus, species and population). We found significant positive correlations between the parasite and viral genetic distances at both the subgenus (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89; F = 10,913.49; p < 0.001) and species level (focusing on *L.* (Viannia) spp.; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59; F = 1,254; p < 0.001).

This was corroborated by additional co-phylogenetic methods (global-fit and event-based), indicating a strong pattern of phylogenetic congruence between *Leishmania* and LRV up to the species level. Only at the population level, focusing on the interactions of *L.* (V.) *braziliensis* and *L.* (V.) *guyanensis* with LRV1, we found weaker co-phylogenetic signals accompanied by more instances of intraspecific host switching. Overall, our findings provide, for the first time, analytical evidence for the co-evolution between *Leishmania* and LRV, with co-speciation as the predominant process, while also shedding light on how such symbioses were maintained over larger time scales.
