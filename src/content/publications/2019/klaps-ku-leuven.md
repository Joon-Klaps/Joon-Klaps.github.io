## Abstract

Flowers offer a wide variety of substrates suitable for microbial growth. However, the
microbiological study of flowers has only recently begun to be systematically
addressed, and our knowledge about floral-inhabiting microorganisms is yet very
limited. The aim of this study was to assess the diversity of culturable yeasts associated
with three floral microhabitats –namely, nectar, stamina and styles– of Metrosideros
polymorpha Gaud. (Myrtaceae), a tree endemic to Hawaii. Yeast isolates recovered
from floral samples were identified by sequencing different regions of the ribosomal
RNA operon and classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Furthermore,
rarefaction-based estimators were used to assess the diversity and composition of the
flower-dwelling yeast communities. Our results showed that M. polymorpha flowers are
inhabited by species-poor yeast communities (<42 predicted OTUs, of which we
recovered c.50%) that are dominated by ascomycetous taxa (75% of observed OTUs).
Furthermore, the yeast communities associated to specific floral structures showed
certain differentiation in their OTU richness and phylogenetic diversity, both of which
were higher for styles and stamina than for nectar. Finally, our mycological survey led
to the discovery of two novel yeast lineages that diverged phylogenetically and
phenotypically from previously described taxa, and might represent new species within
the anamorphic genus Candida. Future work should clarify the taxonomic status and
ecology of these new yeast lineages.
