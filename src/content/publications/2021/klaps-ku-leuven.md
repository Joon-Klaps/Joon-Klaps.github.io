## Abstract

Bacteroides fragilis is one of the most abundant Gram-negative bacteria in the human
gut microbiota and has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal
cancer and various other diseases. Interestingly, the nontoxigenic counterpart of B.
fragilis is increasingly suggested as a probiotic due to its beneficial interactions with the
host. We hypothesized that this contradiction could be explained by the existence of
diversifying subspecies or the exchange of mobile genetic elements encoding for
pathogenic and virulence factors. In this master thesis research, we analysed the
genomic diversity of B. fragilis aiming to comprehend the exceptional but varying
properties of this species, which remain poorly understood. We first compiled all the
available genomes from multiple geographic locations and sources into a large-scale
dataset of over a thousand sequences. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses
revealed numerous lineages, which were supported by pangenomic analyses,
suggesting a common diversification of the core and accessory genomes, and
reinforcing the concept of subspecies in B. fragilis. In total, we identified 18 distinct
lineages, 15 of them were significantly associated with multidrug resistance encoding
genes, and several others with distinct carbohydrate metabolism genes. Additionally,
multiple mobile elements were detected containing virulence factors and stress
resistance genes. In summary, our study confirms the widely underestimated genetic
diversity of Bacteroides fragilis.
