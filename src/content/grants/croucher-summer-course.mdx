Received a scholarship for the Croucher Summer Course at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in August 2024. The award covers travel and accommodation for a week-long intensive training program. The course focuses on advanced topics in viral epidemiology. It brings together international students and experts. Honored to participate and expand my scientific network and to have learned from the best.
