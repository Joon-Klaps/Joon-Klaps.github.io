[nf-core](https://nf-co.re) is a collaborative, community-driven project that provides a collection of high-quality, peer-reviewed bioinformatics pipelines built using Nextflow. The project was born out of the need to standardise workflows across different research groups and make complex bioinformatics analyses more accessible and reproducible.

I'm part of the nf-core maintainer team where I review modules and pipeline modifications. I'm the main developer of [viralmetagenome](https://nf-co.re/viralmetagenome) for untargeted viral genome reconstruction and also a maintainer of the [viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon) pipeline, a pipeline for targeted viral genome reconstruction.
