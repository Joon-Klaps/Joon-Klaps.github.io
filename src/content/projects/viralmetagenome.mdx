[nf-core/viralmetagenome](https://github.com/nf-core/viralmetagenome) is a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for untargeted viral genome reconstruction and intra-host variant identification from metagenomic sequencing data. Built with within nf-core, it follows best practices for reproducible and scalable bioinformatics workflows.

As the main developer, I created viralmetagenome to address the need for standardized viral genomics analysis in metagenomic datasets. The pipeline enables researchers to reconstruct high-quality viral genomes from complex samples and identify genetic variants crucial for understanding viral evolution, drug resistance, and pathogenesis.
