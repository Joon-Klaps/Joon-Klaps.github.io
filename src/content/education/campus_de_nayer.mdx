I completed both my BSc and MSc in Biochemical Engineering.
For my master's thesis, I worked with the [PME & BIM](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/pme-bim) group under the supervision of [Bart Lievens](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rZb6JTwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sergio Alvarez Perez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X8_J4FEAAAAJ&hl=nl).
During this research, I was able to formally describe two new yeast taxa that we discovered in a Hawaiian flower.
