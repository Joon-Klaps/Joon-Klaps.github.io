  I did my second master studies at KU Leuven and my thesis at the raeslab (VIB & KU Leuven)

I did a MSc in Bioinformatics where my Master's Thesis focused on the evolution and spread of a toxin in bacteroides fragilis.
Here, I was supervised by [Rodrigo Bacigalupe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZpZFX7UAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jeroen Raes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ff13MYIAAAAJ&hl=nl) at the Rega Institute.
