I'm doing my PhD at the group of evolutionary and computational virology under supervision of [Prof. Philippe Lemey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HwjuEaUAAAAJ&hl=en) and
[Liana Kafetzopoulou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MJvnGhMAAAAJ&hl=en). Here, I'm working on analytical tools and infrastructure for viral research, applied to Lassa virus
the causative agent of [Lassa fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lassa-fever)
