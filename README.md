# [My personal website](http://Joon-Klaps.github.io)

The repository holds the code used on my website, [Joon-Klaps.github.io](http://Joon-Klaps.github.io).

This website is taken from the personal template of [phil.ewels.co.uk](https://phil.ewels.co.uk), which was in its turn a strongly modified version of the Astro template [manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website).

## Development

To run the website locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd Joon-Klaps.github.io
npm install
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
