The repository holds the code used on my website, [joon.klaps.github.io](http://joon.klaps.github.io).

This website is taken from the personal template of [phil.ewels.co.uk](https://phil.ewels.co.uk), which was in its turn a strongly modified version of the Astro template [manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astro-modern-personal-website).
